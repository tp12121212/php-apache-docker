If you are an Android tinkerer and love the world of flashing ROMs on your bootloader-unlocked device through a custom recovery, here's some good news.

CyanogenMod is officially building nightlies for the Honor 5X. If you don't remember, the Honor 5X is a $200 smartphone which was one of the first to bring flagship-level features to a mid-ranger aimed at consumers who really prioritize great value.



Well, one of the things US customers didn't like was Huawei's EMUI which...]]>&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Even as we expect the Note7 to be successful as well, research firm Strategy Analytics says that an estimated 13.3 million Samsung Galaxy S7 edge units sold around the world for the first half of 2016.

The research firm says the phone's dual-edged display played a role in capturing customers' attention as well as the "user-friendliness", extensive distribution channels, and very high brand awareness. What the research firm forgot to mention was the generous amount of...]]>&lt;/p&gt;</description>

"Basic bands" are defined as "devices serving a specific set of purposes that act as accessories to smart devices, are designed to be worn on the body and not carried and cannot run third party computing applications."

Fitbit leads this market with 3.7 million shipments in Q2 of 2016. Xiaomi is just behind with 3 million shipments while Garmin finds itself as the #3 basic band provider and shipped 700,000 units in the same period.



According to Canalys' research, Fitbits number of basic bands shipped...]]>&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This will be going out in stages to all computers running Windows 10 (and that's more than 350 million devices as of the end of June). Because of the slow rollout, you're probably not going to see the update coming through today, but it should arrive within the next few days.

The Anniversary Update for Windows 10 Mobile was supposed to go out today too, but it isn't. Instead, it will be out "in the coming weeks" - unfortunately Microsoft isn't saying anything less vague about it right now.

Starting tomorrow, T-Mobile may be slashing $200 off the prices of the Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 edge, and the Galaxy Note5.

The $200 off promo applies only to users who are transferring their number to T-Mobile US and choose to buy one of those three handsets.





The offer can be also combined with the Carrier Freedom program, where you can get up to $650 for returning your old smartphone.

This offer is coming from a leaked slide and is not available just yet. It...]]>&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The revenue for the period is $598.4 million (NT$18.9 billion) with a gross margin of 11.4%.





Sadly for HTC, its operating loss is $132.9 million (NT$4.2 billion). However, HTC has sold the land under its property in Taoyuan, which got it $31 million (NT$1.0 billion) in its pocket.

HTC expect sales momentum of the HTC 10 to continue. The company continues regional and channel expansion in...]]>&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We have already told you when you can expect to purchase (and pre-order) it in the US, but what about Europe?

Unlike some past Samsung smartphone launches, the Note7 isn't going to become available in Europe at the same time as the US, where pre-orders start tomorrow and the phone will be out on August 19. Instead, over in Europe it will be officially up for pre-order starting on August 16. And you can expect it to be in stock on September...]]>&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Samsung wants to make sure we know it and has published some details on the stylus that's not really a stylus.



For starters, the Note7's S Pen is water resistant with an IP68 certification to match the phone itself. And we don't mean it just won't die - it actually works under water. It's electromagnetic resonance (EMR) technology that does the trick, and the digitizer in the phone can communicate with the internal coil in the S Pen to identify its position and...]]>&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The phapbet arrived along with many new features, but few might actually have the scope and potential long-lasting effects as the Samsung Cloud.



Yes, it is safe to technically say that the Korean giant has entered into the popular cloud realm as well. And what the "technically" part refers to is the fact that in its current state the platform seems to be somewhat of an extension of Samsung's Smart Switch application.

If you're feeling overwhelmed, I have a few short and sweet ways to introduce you to the Note7.

First up, there's the infographic. But if you don't feel like scrolling, you can just watch a 30-second video that shows the best of the new flagship.



If you have another 30 seconds to spare, here's a video that shows the Galaxy Note philosophy: "More everything."



Now for a deeper look - a whole 3 minutes with the Note7 and its new features.



And finally, here's a promo of the Gorilla Glass 5...]]>&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Conveniently, the key improvements have been highlighted in (non-coral) blue, and the list starts with the dual-edged display of the just-introduced model. Perhaps Samsung could have pointed out the Cat.9 LTE over the Note5's Cat.6 (450Mbps vs 300Mbps downlink), but hey, they have marketing teams to decide on that.

Of course, the IP68...]]>&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The 12.5" laptop with Intel Core m3 is now available for order at CNY 3,499 or about $530. The device will be officially released on August 9, 10AM, which means the pre-orders will be handled with the first come - first served rule. Xiaomi also states that a pre-order does not guarantee a product as the first batch will be quite limited.

The 13.3" Mi Notebook Air with Core i5 CPU and NVIDIA GeForce 940MX GPU is also available for pre-order at CNY 4,999 ($755), but there is no exact availability date.

Now the practicalities.

The Gear VR headset that will take the new Note and via adapters will be backwards compatible with smartphones going back to the Galaxy S6, will be up for pre-order in the US starting tomorrow, August 3, alongside the phone itself. And just like the phone, it will be available for purchase from August 19, so you shouldn't have to spend a day VR-less. Price is set at $99.



The Gear 360 spherical camera, which was announced this spring, hasn't yet made it to stores. Well, that's about to change....]]>&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The initiative is part of the Samsung Promotions program and will be active for a limited time.





The happy new Galaxy Note7 or S7 edge owners will also get $20 in rewards when they make their first Samsung Pay purchase. The last bit of free stuff is a $25 voucher for Google Play Store games.

There's no Gear VR bundle this time around, though.

The new flagship will help Samsung venture deeper into several market segments.

The Note7 is tough. It's the first Note to be waterproofed - IP68 rating certifies it for depths beyond 1m. The phone's metal frame is sandwiched between two symmetrically curved sheets of Gorilla Glass 5. The new Blue Coral option paints the metal and accents in gold, the rest in blue.

Samsung's Unpacked event in New York is starting in mere minutes, and the next-gen phablet is the star of the show.

There isn't much Samsung can surprise us with, as most of the details have already gone public one way or another. It's the event that we're more interested in then, and it won't be easy to top the Galaxy S7/S7 edge unveiling in Barcelona this spring. That's precisely what we expect to happen, though.
